# CIS-194-Homework-Spring-2013

This was [a course](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) the internet recommended for learning the programming language Haskell. I would recommend it as well after finishing it.

For the final project I did a [Chip-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) interpreter since it goes against the grain of pure functional programming. I didn't finish it, but I got the general control flow done which was what I wanted to learn about.
